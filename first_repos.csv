+It's easy to do *italics* or __make things bold__.
+
+> All models are wrong, but some are useful. An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem. Absolute certainty is a privilege of uneducated minds-and fanatics. It is, for scientific folk, an unattainable ideal. What you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while. We cannot expect anyone to know anything we didn't teach them ourselves. Enthusiasm is a form of social courage.

+x <- 3 * 4

+## Preparation for workshop
+
+### R and RStudio
+
+Download and install [R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics](http://www.r-project.org) from [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is _highly recommended_ to install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked to above!
+
+Install RStudio, a powerful user interface for R: <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/>. If you wish, you can read more about how to use RStudio [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/). It's fairly self-explanatory and we will point out major features.
+
+### Testing testing
+
+* Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see [here](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/), but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code or made any figures yet!
+
+* Put your cursor in the pane labelled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. Obviously you should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you are good to go.
+
+## Add-on packages
+
+R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a _package_ via CRAN and github.
+
+Please install the [`knitr` package](http://yihui.name/knitr/) for report generation and its dependencies. Here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others):
+
+```
+install.packages(""knitr"", dependencies = TRUE)
+```
+
+We will also be joined by Scott Chamberlain from [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org), who will share a short demo. To follow along in this section, please install the packages `rplos` (for retrieving literature data from the Public Library of Science) and `tm` (for text mining).

+Talk at SFU Friday November 29, 2013
+
+Title: Reproducible research, open science, and all that good stuff
+for people who use R to do stats
+
+There is a huge buzz these days around changing practices in all
+aspects of data analysis. I will go over some recent exciting
+developments that are particularly relevant for the statistics
+community, especially for users of R. We'll talk about R Markdown, the
+knitr package, handy features of the RStudio IDE, and Git(Hub). And
+how to get all of these things working together! The first 45 minutes
+will be a somewhat conventional talk, perhaps with some demos, with
+many opportunities for questions and discussion. Then we will have
